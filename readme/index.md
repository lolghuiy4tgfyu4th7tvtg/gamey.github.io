## Welcome to Gamey
Gamey is a Game Archiving App similar to BlueMaxima's Flashpoint.

To use Gamey, download the latest release on Github (https://github.com/lolghuiy4tgfyu4th7tvtg/gamey), or go to https://lolghuiy4tgfyu4th7tvtg.github.io/gamey/.

### How Gamey Gets Games
To get the Flash and HTML games that gamey uses, it uses a game map on the gamey website. Usually, the files
are downloaded either from the Internet Archive (http://archive.org/) or one of my websites 
(http://byte127x.github.io/ or https://lolghuiy4tgfyu4th7tvtg.github.io/gamey/)

### How to download Gamey?
You can go to the "Actual Source Code" folder in this repository, or go to the releases tab.
