## Welcome to the Source Code
Yay! You Made it past the Website Stuff! This is _only_ the source code of Gamey
[This is the source code for the first version btw](https://github.com/lolghuiy4tgfyu4th7tvtg/gamey/files/7892967/Source.Code.zip)

But, Gamey is written in Python and requires several dependencies ...
These dependencies are ...
> Tkinter 8.6+ and ttkbootstrap
> 
> Pathlib
> 
> and Requests

You can install these using these commands (if python is in your path)
```
pip install ttkbootstrap
pip install tk
pip install requests
```
This program is still in development (this is literally the first version)
so, be sure to report any bugs you have with the software!

Bye!
