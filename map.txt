One touch from any of these ghosts means loss of a life for Pac-Man.\n\nPac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating one of the four Power-Pills located around the maze.\nDuring this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time as the ghosts' eyes\nfloat back to their center box and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions starring Pac-Man and the ghosts.
